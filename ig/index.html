On the subject of petitions, there are alot of change.org petitions roaming around, and while I don't think it hurts to sign off on them as I've been coming across them (DO NOT DONATE TO CHANGE.ORG) I don't think they all necessarily do any good, so I'm going to focus on petitions I find that actually require you to show proof of constituency and hopefully make an impact on our lawmakers.</p> -->
