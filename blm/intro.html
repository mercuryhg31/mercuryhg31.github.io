				So because I've built this in mind for the way I want to use this and for being used on Google Chrome... it's a little bit annoying.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you click next, you'll be taken to a site with the fundraising video embedded. For a view and for ad revenue to count, the user HAS to click on the video themself, I can't set it to autoplay. When you open the site, it will automatically open a tab that plays 8 seconds of a really annoying sound. This is so that everytime the site loads, you hear it and know to click the play button on the newly loaded video again. If you don't wanna hear this sound, then go ahead and mute the tab that it'll open with the sound too. I recommend you open this site in a new window of its own if that's your plan. Otherwise, just mute this tab, so that only the fundraising video will be muted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Assuming you're using Google Chrome, to mute a site, you right click on the tab, click "Mute site", and from then on, all websites belonging to the domain you are on will be muted, unless you right click again and unmute. You should be able to use this site on other browsers too, I've just made this this annoying to get around the way Chrome works.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure that you don't skip any ads and that you don't mute the YT video in the embedded player itself (audio has to be 50% or higher for it to count). Don't 2x the speed or skip over parts or anything. Just let it play.
