                This project was one of the most interesting projects done this year amongst the many history projects. Finished on Feburary 14, 2017 in my group of three people, this was a parody of a country song on the topic of communism during the age of the Industrial Revolution. We had to hold a meeting at my house specifically to finish writing the lyrics of the song and finally record it. Instead of using a karaoke accompaniment, I played a few keys on the piano, so as to allow the actual singing to be heard since we were all very quiet. While I wrote only a few of the actual lyrics, I did find information that we could incorporate into the song. I also recorded and edited the song. If I had to do something differently, however, I would have attempted to make the recording of our voices louder.

                    This was a very enjoyable project and arguably the largest one this year in C.A.B. (Computer Applications in Business). A group of three to four people were required to create a short video serving as a public service announcement on some topic related to technology. My group decided to create a PSA on the dangerous uses of technology and its unfortunate outcomes. It was a large effort, since we had to record making sure the audio and visual was satisfactory despite the disruptive background noise. I, as the editor, was also responsible for compiling the video clips so they followed a clear chronological flow. In general, this project was a fun way to explore the misuse of technology while exercising my own skills.

                    This paper was the biggest project of my English class and around two months in the making. It was completed on April 19, 2017. The paper required four pages on some current event not in the United States or Britain. I wrote on the rather controversial issue of the 2016 Indian demonetization. Writing on this topic allowed me to explore the global business and finance world, since I had to make a stand on whether or not this was a good things or not for India. I also compared the economical status of other nations. Though I was not originally interested in business, this project was nonetheless interesting.
