                    This was our very first problem set, due on October 1, 2017. The assignment was simply to replicate this ePortfolio, albeit with a few different requirements. I liked doing this project because I already had experience coding websites from scratch with HTML and CSS, and this was, at the time, the fanciest site I’d created, since previous to this project, I didn’t know how to link multiple HTML pages. My favorite part of building a website is the design, and this project really let me style the CSS however I liked. As I’m interested in IT, any project from this class would be relevant to my interests. This artifact, specifically, plays to my interest in potentially being a front-end web developer. If I were to make any changes, it would be to add even more to the styling of the web page, perhaps using the Javascript I now know.

                    I chose this artifact because I particularly enjoyed doing this project. Our presentation answered the question of whether film or literature was a better medium to convey a horror story. Because we were comparing these two mediums, we were able to create a multimedia presentation, with pictures, videos, and audio. I liked the flexibility of our source types. I also thought that this was a very well-put together presentation. The only thing I would’ve done differently is show up to actually present the project, since I had a fever the day of the presentation.

                    I liked making a résumé (completed June 13, 2018) that outlined all my skills. I feel like this helped me understand how I should go about getting employed in the future. Discussing my future and career path helped me gain perspective of my life and where I want to take it. It also helped me figure out what I should work on to get to where I want to go. The only thing I would’ve done differently on the résumé is format it better and find some way to add the few other things that I didn’t put in.

                    This assignment was to simply make something that communicated information about one of the reform movements during the Age of Reform (done March 22, 2018). I liked this project simply because I spent most of it just coding the website. It was fun designing it and making the sidebar. It’s obviously relevant to the IT path, and there’s nothing I would’ve done differently.
