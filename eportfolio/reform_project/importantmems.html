            <h1>Important Members/Organizations</h1>
            <h3>American Temperance Society (ATS)</h3>
            <p>The ATS was founded in Boston was the first popular organization that promoted temperance. The purpose of this organization was to to get rid of &quot;drunkards&quot; and to restore morality to American society and culture. The formation of this organization was the start of the national temperance movement in the U.S. Like other temperance societies, they promoted abstinence of strong alcohol, insisting on the drinking of wine and beer alone. Over time, the organization pushed for absence from all alcohol and pushed for the legal prohibition of alcohol, not only voluntary abstinence. They did so by hiring speakers and publishing articles on the negative effects of alcohol.  Many of its members have taken the pledge to abstain from drinking distilled spirits.  By the mid-1830s, there were more than 200,000 people belonging to the American Temperance Society. </p>
            <h3>Women&apos;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)</h3>
            <p>The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in November of  1874.  These women protested for the sake of the women that drunken husbands and fathers would always abuse.  The movement spread rapidly, and eventually focused on other areas of society concerning women&apos;s rights, in addition to alcohol and temperance.</p>
            
            <h3>Lyman Beecher</h3>
            <img src="http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/images/d/d1/Beecher%2C_Lyman.jpg"/>
            <p>Lyman Beecher was a Presbyterian Minister who was concerned about the condition of society at the time.  As alcoholism and immorality were rampant in America, Church attendance declined, thus he took it upon himself to promote absenteeism and temperance.  He would soon become a co-founder of the American Temperance Society in order to reduce alcohol consumption in the U.S., so that people would start attending church more often.</p>
            <p>Beecher argued that temperance was needed because civic morality was indispensable for the preservation of the government.  He claimed, "We may form free constitutions, but our vices will destroy them; we may enact laws, but they will not protect us."  The only way to do this was by maintaining Christianity within the nation.  This is why he would use religion when discussing preaching against alcohol.  He formed the "six sermons," which were famous sermons discussing the sins and evil of alcohol and alcoholism.  He would also organize "camp meetings" and "revivals." Overall, Beecher was very influential in converting alcoholics and setting the stage for even more alcoholics to be converted as well.</p>
            
            <h3>John B. Gough</h3>

            <p>JJohn B. Gough was a recovering drunkard, who in 1842 began lecturing people against drinking and alcohol in accordance with the Temperance movement.  Gough was an extremely popular and famous lecturer, giving over 9,600 lectures to over nine million people in America, Canada, and Britain, for over forty years.  Often, he relied upon the use of his past experience as a drunkard to better connect with his audience and provide a unique understanding and perspective on alcoholism and its effects.  Gough's lectures were often so powerful, that at one of his speeches, hundreds of thousands of people took "the pledge."  Because of his effectiveness at converting drinkers, Gough became one of America's first celebrities.  In 1886, the New York Times wrote that he was the best known public speaker.</p>
            <p>Gough strongly believed that alcohol was dangerous because it could destroy one's life.  This was learned through self experience.  Gough began drinking following his mother's death, and this only grew worse after his wife and daughter passed away.  From his alcoholism, he became homeless and unemployed.  Eventually, he attended a temperance meeting, where he signed "the pledge," understanding the harm that could come of it.  Gough even wrote an article, "The Dangers of Moderate Drinking," that detail his point further.</p>
            <h3>Carrie Nation</h3>
            <img src="http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Carrie_Nation_1910.jpg"/>
            <p class="last">Carrie Nation's strong distaste for alcohol was very well founded.  As a young woman, 
            Carrie Nation married her first husband, Charles Gloyd, who secretly had a severe drinking 
            problem.  Not knowing this, she became pregnant with his kid.  However, she realized that 
            Gloyd would not be able to take care of her and her child because of his alcoholism, forcing 
            her to return home.  This turned out to be even more true after Gloyd died six months later 
            from his alcoholism.  Carrie was forced to sell many of her possessions in order to build a
            small home for her family.  As a deeply religious woman and the wife of a preacher, Carrie
            would affiliate herself with the WCTU, where she would lobby for social reform.  However, 
            she was better known for her methods of causing bars to close down.  Originally, Carrie 
            would say prayers and sing hymns outside of bars, which would cause them to close down.  
            But later, Carrie began to use more violent tactics.  Rather than use prayers, she would 
            use bricks, and caused thousands of dollars in damages to bars across Kansas, eventually 
            adopting the use of a hatchet as well.</p>
