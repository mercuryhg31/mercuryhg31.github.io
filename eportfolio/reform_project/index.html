            <h3>Goals of the Temperance Movement</h3>
            <p>The Temperance Movement's main goal was to promote heavy moderation or even complete abstinence of intoxicating beverages such as alcohol. The movement viewed alcohol as a threat to the good of society and wanted to reduce its usage and influence on society's behavior and actions, as often it would cause many problems</p>
            <h3>Causes for the Temperance Movement</h3>
            <p class="last">There were multiple causes for the Temperance Movement to spread across America.  The first main cause would be religious beliefs.  Many citizens believed that society was becoming very immoral, one of they key parts of it becoming so being alcoholism.  They believed that God would not bless an alcoholic US, and thus wanted to make sure that alcoholism did not root itself into American society.  The second main cause would be domestic violence and alcohol abuse.  Very frequently, drunkards and alcoholics would often have very little judgement, and would beat and harm their wives and children.  This was extremely bad for society, as many defenseless people were being hurt by their drunken husbands/fathers.  As a result, many people wanted alcohol reform to prevent things like this from occurring.  The final main reason was self ruin.  Drunkards and alcoholics would often drink themselves to ruin.  Workers would take "rum" breaks and would not work as efficiently.  By not being able to work properly, they would lose their employment and struggle to maintain their lives in society.</p>
