            <h3>Statistics</h3>

            <p style="width:55vw">Between 1800 and 1830, whiskey, which was cheaper than rum, flooded the market, and people ( 15 and up) drank 6.6-7.1 gallons of alcohol. Women and kids are the main victim of alcohol abuse. The goal was to regulate the amount of alcohol consumed.</p>
            
            <h3>Laws Passed</h3>
            <p class="last" style="width:55vw">As influential as the Temperance Movement was, it took a long time for any Temperance laws to be passed in the government.  In 1838, Massachusetts passed a law banning selling spirits in amounts less than 15 gallons, in order to prevent people from purchasing alcohol.  However, this failed and was repealed in just two years.  However, Maine was able to pass a statewide Prohibition law in 1846, and many other states followed suits until before the civil war.  Later, in the Early 20th century, when the movement's influence would rise once again, a nationwide Prohibition law was passed.</p>
