            <h3>The Pledge</h3>
            <p>&quot;The Pledge&quot; was a document that people sign to say that they will stop drinking alcohol. At first, the pledge required people not drink any heavy liquor like whiskey and gin. There were also distinctions over what types of alcohol would be allowed as wine and beer was said to have some health benefits. Over time it was to give up alcohol completely.</p>
            <p>The pledge was signed at a public meeting having witnesses so it is more enforced. The people that were there to see the pledge being sign would also cheer those who signed it. The document was not a standard document as many were either a simple blank sheet or an elaborate contract with many many people&apos;s signature or an individual&apos;s signature.</p>
            <h3>Camp Meetings</h3>
            <p class="last">Camp Meetings were events held by organizations trying to support temperance.  At these meetings, many preachers would be hosted.  These preachers would preach about alcohol and the sins that come with it, effectively persuading all those who attend to avoid alcohol wherever possible.  Often these events were extremely large-scale and resulted in numerous conversions.  Often people would sign &quot;the pledge&quot; at places like these, along with hundreds or even thousands of others.</p>
