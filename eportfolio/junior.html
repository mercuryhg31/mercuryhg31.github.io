					This was our final for Database II. Our task was to design a database for a hospital network that adequately met their needs as detailed in the project. This was a culmination of everything we'd learned that year. I had to model out my database using Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler, which you can see on slide 14 (this is called the Logical Model). I then also turned every entity into table format as it would be represented when written in SQL. I engineered the Logical Model to a Relational Model, which graphically represented the connections between these tables and included how the foreign keys would function.

					For this course, I had to submit to CollegeBoard a group paper and presentation and an individual paper and presentation. Before we began this, we had the time to do a practice group paper and presentation. This is that first practice group presentation. I'm really proud of this project because I learned a lot from it. It was not a topic I would have chosen to research were it not for my group members, and I am really glad they did because I learned a lot about a really large issue that would've otherwise never been on my radar. I really enjoyed working with the people I worked with, and we recieved an excellent grade on this. It was a great jumping point for the class, and there's absolutely nothing different I would have done.

			<center>
				<p style="width: 25vw; display: inline-block; text-align: justify">
					This was our final for this class. It was a calm way to end the year after having taken the AP exam. We had the chance to apply a calculus concept I'd learned that year to a real-life situation. This was a group project, and another one of my group members happened to be in my Capstone class as well, so our real-life application was an idea we actually got from something we'd read in that class. My teacher often went out of his way to contextualize Calculus, and this was a way for us to do that for ourselves.
